# 🌍 Genesis Chain – Turning Education Into Living Worlds

An immersive **Reality-as-a-Service platform** where students step **inside knowledge worlds**, teachers earn **royalties**, and progress is stored **on-chain forever**.

🎮 **Demo (Prototype):** \[Coming Soon – Unity Sandbox Build]
📜 **Genesis NFT Explorer:** \[Placeholder Link – Polygon Testnet]

⚠️ *Note: GitHub Pages cannot serve compressed Unity WebGL builds correctly (Brotli/Gzip issue). For the best experience, try the Unity sandbox demo.*

## 🌟 Features

✅ AI-powered **Genesis World Builder** (vibe coding → instant 3D world)

✅ Students **explore history, science, math** as immersive simulations

✅ **AI NPC guides** (e.g., Galileo teaching gravity experiments)

✅ Progress minted as **Genesis NFTs** (permanent, tamper-proof)

✅ **Teacher marketplace** with royalties via smart contracts

✅ Stored on **IPFS/Arweave** for permanence

---

## 🕹 How It Works

1. Teacher types: *“Create a world of Newton’s Laws with puzzles on gravity.”*
2. AI generates an explorable **Genesis World** instantly.
3. Students enter via web/VR/AR and interact with NPCs.
4. Student progress → minted as an **NFT badge** stored in their wallet.
5. Schools & teachers share a **global library of reusable worlds**.
