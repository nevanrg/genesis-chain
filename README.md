🌍 Genesis Chain: Turning Education Into Living Worlds

Reality-as-a-Service for Education
Students don’t just read about knowledge — they step inside it.

✨ Vision

Education today is passive, fragile, and centralized. Genesis Chain transforms it into an immersive, decentralized, and permanent learning ecosystem:

📚 Students explore knowledge as living worlds — stand inside pyramids, talk to Galileo, farm along the Nile.

🎓 Teachers mint Genesis Worlds — earn royalties when reused by others.

🔗 Blockchain secures learning forever — progress & credentials become NFTs owned by students.

🌐 Schools join a global library of living worlds — knowledge shared, remixed, and owned collectively.

🚀 How It Works

World Builder (Vibe Coding)

Teachers describe a lesson in plain language.

AI + procedural generation creates a 3D Genesis World instantly.

Student Portal

Students enter via web/VR/AR.

AI-powered NPCs guide them through challenges.

Progress is tracked automatically.

Genesis NFT Minting

Completing modules mints NFTs recording proof-of-learning.

NFTs stored in wallets → portable across schools and employers.

Teacher Marketplace

Upload, buy, and remix Genesis Worlds.

Smart contracts ensure royalties for creators.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend / World Rendering → Unity + WebXR

AI World Builder → GPT-5 + Stable Diffusion 3D + procedural generation

Blockchain Layer → Ethereum L2 / Polygon
